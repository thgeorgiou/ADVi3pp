// The preferred way to build ADVi3++ is with PlatformIO. With PlatformIO, you can easily build BLTouch and non-BLtouch releases.
// If for whatever reason, you prefer to use Arduino IDE, uncomment the following line to:

// build a Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus (aka Mark I, mainboard version 5.1):
// #define ADVi3PP_51

// build an Aldi UK Balco 2018 release (mainboard version 5.2C)
// WARNING: For HE180021 models only (2018). For the 2017 models (UK) or 2019 models (Belgium), use ADVi3PP_51
// #define ADVi3PP_52C

// build a Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus Mark II (mainboard version 5.4):
// #define ADVi3PP_54

// build a BLTouch release.
// #define BLTOUCH

#ifdef ADVi3PP_DEBUG

    // To log various aspects of ADVi3++
    #define ADVi3PP_LOG

    // To log the content of frames, uncomment the following line. Very chatty, but useful to debug tough bugs
    // #define ADVi3PP_LOG_FRAMES
    // #define ADVi3PP_LOG_ALL_FRAMES // Log all the frames, including those that are updating the status

    // Break with the asm instruction break
    // #define ADVi3PP_HARD_BREAK

    // Enable detailed logging of G28, G29, M48, etc. Turn on with the command 'M111 S32'.
    #define MARLIN_DEV_MODE

    // Enable leveling debugging for DEBUG builds
    #define DEBUG_LEVELING_FEATURE

#endif

// Define only when using ADVi3++ Hardware simulator (endstops)
//#define ADVi3PP_HARDWARE_SIMULATOR

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Do not modify the following definitions
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This is only to ensure that Jetbrains CLion is parsing code properly inside the IDE (intellisense)
